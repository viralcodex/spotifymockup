Spotify Mobile App (Music Player) Mockup using HTML and CSS.

assets folder contains necessary images and fonts used.

Note:"Gotham" font family is used and imported from 'CDN FONTS' in the CSS.

I've also included the web-font format for the same if you wanna use them locally without importing them from a website.

Just link stylesheet.css present in assets/fonts/ folder in the html to use them using this line.

<link href="assets/fonts/stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet">

The only problem being the "Gotham Bold" is added to the stylesheet.

I'll update the fonts as soon as possible to use them locally.
